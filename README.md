# NWJS Generator
## Plan
Current plan is that this generator will give the user a ready-to-go template with all the basic features you can expect from a standard desktop application which include but not limit to:

* Standard shortcut support
* Preferences Panel for Mac
* File Operation (if the app is document-based)

And the generator also supports grunt for automatic distribution generation.
